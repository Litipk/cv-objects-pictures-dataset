# CV Objects Pictures Dataset
A repository with objects photographs, plus background photographs, to train VC systems.

It has:
  * Two different backgrounds: "white" bakground, and wooden background.
  * Photographs of 26 different objects, belonging to 4 object classes (cups, scissors, clothespins, and skeins of yarn).

It's recommended to directly download the zip file instead of cloning the repository, because the repository history contains the original images, which aren't scaled and are too big to work comfortably.
