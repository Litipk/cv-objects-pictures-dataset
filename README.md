# CV Objects Pictures Dataset
A repository with objects photographs, plus background photographs, to train CV systems.

It has:
  * Two different backgrounds: "white" bakground, and wooden background.
  * Photographs of 26 different objects, belonging to 4 object classes (cups, scissors, clothespins, and skeins of yarn).
  * A labels CSV file in [`images/objects/labels.csv`](https://github.com/Litipk/cv-objects-pictures-dataset/blob/master/images/objects/labels.csv).

It's recommended to directly download the zip file instead of cloning the repository, because the repository history contains the original images, which aren't scaled and are too big to work comfortably.
